# Fungi
Fungal growth in response to various heavy metal concentrations.

Heavy metals can either be beneficial or detrimental to fungal growth. This phenomenon, described as hormesis, depends on the metal type, concentration, fungal species, and heavy metal tolerance (Morkunas et al., 2018). As the natural environment becomes more contaminated by pollutants, investigating the effects of how heavy metals impact the soil microflora is increasingly important. In many habitats, fungi play a crucial role in the availability of nutrients and physiological processes for plant agriculture.

The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of heavy metals on the growth of fungi. We hypothesized that there would be a difference in the growth of Trichoderma viride and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in response to different concentrations of AlCl3 and MnCl2. It was predicted that the growth of both species of fungi will be largest at 3mM.

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukeyâ€™s HSD test for pairwise comparisons of means was performed using R.
